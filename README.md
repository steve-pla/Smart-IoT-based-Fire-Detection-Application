# Smart-IoT-based-Fire-Detection-Application

Our Smart IoT-based Fire Detection System is an innovative solution designed to enhance fire safety through advanced sensor technology and real-time data analytics. Utilizing high-precision sensors, LoRa communication, and powerful data visualization tools, our system offers reliable and timely detection of potential fire hazards. The system integrates Libelium sensor boards, a Raspberry Pi gateway, The Things Network (TTN), and PostgreSQL databases. High-precision sensors measure environmental factors such as CO2, humidity, O2, and NO2 levels. Data is transmitted over long distances using LoRa technology and processed through TTN, with all sensor data stored in a PostgreSQL database. Our custom Python services fetch this data, enabling comprehensive metric visualization and live-stream user interfaces. Users can securely log in to the web dashboard to monitor real-time metrics, view historical data trends, and receive threshold-based alerts for potential fire events. 

This robust and scalable system provides an essential tool for early fire detection, helping to prevent disasters and protect lives and property. Whether for individual users or public administration, our fire detection system leverages cutting-edge technology to deliver superior performance and peace of mind.

## All-in-One
Our concept utilizes an eco-friendly approach due to the fact that Libelium Waspmote is an ultra-low IoT power device opening the horizon for sustainability and low-cost solutions.

## Hardware, Software and Protocols
This project, combines concepts and technologies from physical layer such ar esp32, software layers such as Python, CSS and middle layer such as mosquitto protocol. Hardware, software and protocols are merged up together to create a web service in which the live state and the sensors metrics are being displayed. It is a 5-tier architecture.Specifically, our project includes these technologies per layer:

## Application Architecture

![Live Streaming Plots](Images/topology.png)

### 1-Layer (Data Sensing)
The first layer of our system is data sensing. Using the Libelium Waspmote, we measure environmental parameters such as CO2, NO2, O2, and humidity. The Waspmote encodes these sensor readings through its shield interface and transmits them via a LoRa module to the next layer for further processing.

### 2-Layer (Data Forwarding)
The second layer of our IoT-based fire detection system is powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. This layer is responsible for receiving sensor data transmitted by the Libelium Waspmote via a LoRa module. Once the Raspberry Pi captures the sensor values, it processes the data using custom scripts executed through Linux bash commands. The processed data is then streamed through the Raspberry Pi's Ethernet port, enabling it to be transmitted over the internet. This data is sent to The Things Network (TTN) service, which acts as the central hub for data aggregation and analysis. This setup ensures reliable and efficient communication between the sensor nodes and the cloud-based network, facilitating real-time monitoring and response to environmental conditions.

### 3-Layer (Data Distribution)
The third layer leverages The Things Network (TTN) service. This layer plays a crucial role in managing and processing the data received from the Raspberry Pi. Upon receiving the sensor data, TTN stores it in the userâ€™s data catalog, ensuring organized and accessible records. TTN also handles the association between the data gateway and the user account, allowing for secure and efficient data management.

### 4-Layer (Data Fetching/Storing)
The fourth layer is a Python-based service responsible for data retrieval and storage. This service utilizes the MQTT protocol to connect to The Things Network (TTN) API, fetching sensor data from the user catalog every 2 seconds. Once retrieved, the data is processed and inserted into the 'Measurements' table of a PostgreSQL database. This setup ensures that sensor readings are continuously updated in the database, providing a reliable and up-to-date record of environmental conditions.

### 5-Layer (Web Service, back/front-end)
The fifth and final layer of our system is a Python Flask web service that provides a comprehensive user interface for interacting with the collected data. This layer includes several key features: it offers pages for plotting various metrics, allowing users to visualize and analyze sensor data trends over time; a live-stream values page to monitor real-time sensor readings and user authentication and registration functionalities to manage access and ensure secure interactions with the system. The front-end part resides on the user browser.
